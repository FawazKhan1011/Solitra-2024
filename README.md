• This project was made in Unity2D suite which is a 2d Unity game engine for
developing 2 – dimensional games, Graphics and Animation<br/><br/>
• The Coding language Used for this project was C#, which was used to give behaviour
to the 2d objects in the game through scripting.<br/><br/>
• I used various Unity components such as Colliders and rigid bodies to simulate
physics in the game<br/><br/>
• The UI of the game was created Using Unity’s canvas component which is used to
create responsive User interfaces for the games<br/><br/>
• I created the movement logic by using the rect component of the Player and moving it
using the formula: ‘position + movement * moveSpeed * Time.fixedDeltaTime’.<br/><br/>
• For the winning confetti effect I used Unity’s particle system to simulate particles for
the game<br/><br/>
• I used Unity’s Scene Management to transition between different scenes to make the
game smother and linear.<br/><br/>
• I used ASCT texture compression method for compressing the textures of the game to
optimize and reduce its build so that it runs smoother on phones.<br/><br/>
• For iOS version of the game, I used Xcode to build and deploy the game on iOS
devices.<br/><br/>
• I used the onCollision method and destroy functions to handle the coin collecting
logic so that when the colliders touch the coins are destroyed and the counter is
incremented by 1.<br/><br/>
• For the Music and sound effects for the game, I used Audio Source and Sound
manager to play various sound effects on their respective events.
